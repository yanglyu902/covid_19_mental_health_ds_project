# covid_19_mental_health_ds_project

The COVID-19 pandemic could negatively influence the health of people both physically and psychologically. In this study, we qualify the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and the accessibility to health care of people from different ages, sex, ethnicity, and education groups in the United States. We studied the correlation between different time series and performed causal inferences. We find that COVID-19 has caused a rise in the overall depression and anxiety level, and the allocation of medical resources may not be equal across different demographic groups of people.

The complete analysis notebook can be found in the `analysis` folder.
